1. Why is it LuaSNMP and not LuaMan as the original one ?

   LuaSNMP includes only SNMP related funtions of LuaMAN. It does not
   include DNS and ICMP networking stuff like LuaMan did. DNS is
   alread included in the excellent LuaSocket library from Diego
   Nehab. This library (or an extra one) may be a better home for ICMP
   as well.
